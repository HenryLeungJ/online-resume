    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Ever since I could remember, I was fascinated with computers. I would beg my mother
        to buy me any new electronic device I came across. Now that I have grown older, I
        realized that the true spectacle was what was going behind the scenes of these computers.
        I want to contiunuously grow my learning in the field of computer engineering to constantly
        quench my thirst for innovation in the field.
