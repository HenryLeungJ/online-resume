    Other than computer programming, I have many passions including fitness and connection seaking. <br>
    I aim to always do what is best for my health, weither it be sleeping 8 hours a day,
    drinking large amounts of water, or meeting my protien and calorie goal daily.
    However, the biggest part about fitness for me is going to the gym. The gym
    is a place of constant improvement, everytime I go to the gym, I get better in some way.
    It teaches me continuous discipline, gives me more energy throughout the day, and allows me to
    connect with people through a shared passion for the niche. <br>
    I also love meeting new people. Everyone has a different story and I would love to hear about it all.
    Ever since I learned how to freely express my opinons from attending UBC Sauder, I have always been thirsty
    for my next conversation. I love going to networking events, intermurals, club events, and anything of that sort!
